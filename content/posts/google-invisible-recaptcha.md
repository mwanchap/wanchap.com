Seen this thing?<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v5a1hIRRclM/WIGoJTV5ZGI/AAAAAAAAGZA/ThP1-5p2upQ5WRb8qINtF17a8KvmkaP8wCLcB/s1600/recaptcha_checkbox.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v5a1hIRRclM/WIGoJTV5ZGI/AAAAAAAAGZA/ThP1-5p2upQ5WRb8qINtF17a8KvmkaP8wCLcB/s1600/recaptcha_checkbox.PNG" /></a></div><br />It's certainly well-made but can be confusing for some, especially users that aren't quite as tech-savvy. &nbsp;Some of our clients are older people and although we've never received any negative feedback, the fact that we even need a checkbox is definitely not ideal.<br /><br />Enter Google's new-and-improved <i>invisible</i> reCAPTCHA! No more checkboxes! No extra clicks! A victory for UX! Except, when registering your site, there's this little caveat (emphasis mine):<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"You agree to <b>explicitly</b> inform visitors to your site that you have implemented the Invisible reCAPTCHA on your site and that <b>their </b>use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use."</blockquote>So we've gone from an ugly, visible checkbox to an invisible checkbox, but one which comes along with a very-visible "explicit" legal disclaimer. &nbsp;I think someone has misunderstood what "invisible" means.<br /><br />The other part that bugs me about this is that I'm required to inform my users about <i>their</i>&nbsp;use of reCAPTCHA, as though it was <i>their</i> decision and any problems they have are <i>their</i>&nbsp;fault, and not mine. &nbsp;Hobson's choices have always bugged me.
